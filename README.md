Employee Management System â€“ Project Description

The Employee Management System (EMS) is a modern, enterprise-grade application built using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and RESTful APIs to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing employees, projects, managers, skills, and related entities within an organization. 
The system is designed with clean architecture principles, separating concerns into entity, repository, service, and controller layers, ensuring maintainability and ease of extension.

At its core, EMS manages the Employee lifecycle, storing personal details such as name, email, phone number, gender, and addresses, along with professional attributes like projects, managers, and skills. 
Each employee is linked to a SalaryBank account, which enforces one-to-one mapping and ensures financial details are tightly coupled with the employee profile. Employees can belong to projects, report to managers, and have multiple addresses classified as permanent or temporary. Skills are managed as a many-to-many relationship, with employees being associated with multiple technical competencies along with ratings.

The project is built with Spring Data JPA to abstract persistence logic, leveraging repositories with derived queries, custom JPQL queries, and pagination support. 
Complex queries such as finding employees by skills, retrieving employees without projects, and generating statistics like counts by project or gender are implemented to demonstrate advanced data handling. APIs are designed to follow REST conventions, returning proper HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found), ensuring a consistent and predictable client experience.

To maintain consistency in responses, a standard ApiResponse wrapper encapsulates metadata such as status, messages, timestamps, and request paths. 
This improves communication between client and server, making debugging and integration smoother. Pagination metadata is also supported for list endpoints, allowing efficient data browsing.

The EMS supports advanced features like searching employees by city and project, retrieving top N employees alphabetically or by skill ratings, filtering by creation dates, and aggregating statistics across projects and skills. 
These features make it highly adaptable to real-world HR and enterprise scenarios.

In summary, the Employee Management System is a scalable, flexible, and production-ready application showcasing best practices in Spring Boot microservice development, database design, and REST API standards, while remaining easy to extend for additional enterprise needs.
